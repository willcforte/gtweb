<span class="centerelement">Over the summer, I began developing this robot with 12 servos, fully-actuated legs, and spare FTC parts from my teacher. It is in the process of being redesigned for lower weight and cable mess. Presently, there is no control system, but this will be implemented soon in Arduino C++, so keep posted.</span>
