## Fully-Actuated Quadruped

As the main project for my robotics independent research study, I am building a fully-actuated quadrupedal robot from low-cost, accessible components.

<br>

Featuring 12 positional servos and a whopping 15 Amps of current, wiring this will be a challengeâ€”yet controlling it will be even harder.

Although the beta prototype is terribly cable-managed, I am designing structures atop the chassis to organize the power delivery, along with a custom perforated board mounted on standoffs.
