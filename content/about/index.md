## About me

I'm William C. Forte, a high school junior who aspires to study engineering.

My interests are pretty diverse (perhaps excessively), so I have experience in the following subjects:

* $\bullet$ Robotics via CAD (Onshape/Fusion360)
* $\bullet$ Programming and mobile/web development (Java/C++, Flutter)
* $\bullet$ Technical writing ($\LaTeX$)
* $\bullet$ 3D Simulation/Animation (Blender/PyMOL)
* $\bullet$ Calculus

## About GTWeb

The idea for my website, GTWeb, started as a place to put the log for the Robotics Gifted & Talented program that I will be taking next year. I now intend for it to serve as a platform to share what I am passionate about and pursue in all of my extracurricular studies. I hope to use it to connect and collaborate with like-minded peers, post fun projects, and develop a portfolio.

<br>

### Tech Stack

At the center of the technical framework of the website lies [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/blog/v3), an open source Javascript library that combines the server-side rendering and static site generation of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), whose logical syntax I admire.

<br>

The text of the website, written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) that has [$\KaTeX$](https://katex.org/), HTML, and Vue support, is interpreted by [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/). CSS styling is done via [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
