### Abstract:

It has been established that graphene is an optimal material for solar
sails [@GAUDENZI] due to its acute response to photon-induced movement
by radiation pressure. We were interested in investigating the use of
this property to detect the presence of particles.

Our experiment seeks to determine the effect of particle collisions on
graphene, both by photons (as in solar sails) and other particles.
