GRAPHS is our proposal of a graphene-based detector of radiation pressure, written in LaTeX. It was submitted for the 2023 CERN Beamline for Schools physics competition.

GRAPHS $\implies$ Graphene Rotational Acceleration Particle Hall Sensor

### Abstract:

It has been established that graphene is an optimal material for solar
sails<sup>\[3\]</sup> due to its acute response to photon-induced movement
by radiation pressure. We were interested in investigating the use of
this property to detect the presence of particles.

<br>

Our experiment seeks to determine the effect of particle collisions on
graphene, both by photons (as in solar sails) and other particles.
