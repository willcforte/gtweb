# Why write a blog?

## Developing communication skills

What reason is there for I, an undergraduate student, to write (or attempt to write) a blog?

Well, I recognize that it does little to engineer a solution and leave the world ignorant of it. Yet this is what many struggle with:

Deficient communication skills is a rampant disease in the sciences; even lifelong scholars fail to communicate enough to verify their studies, leading to the [replication crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis). I'm simply trying to be proactive in avoiding this all-too-common fate.

**Communication is necessary for someone to derive value from your life's work.** I endeavor to never let this hold back my ideas, even if they are stupid.

And writing consistently helps to improve ones writing ability, it is okay if nobody reads what you write.

Publishing your written work publically is also an incentive for not making it terrible. I apologize if it appears that I've not heeded this point, but I will improve. The experience gained by putting out poor writing pieces will make them good in the long run.

## But how do you write a blog?

The hardest part is overcoming the mental barrier to begin. This must be done regardless of skill: your first works will be terrible--there's no way around it. Write and the skill will follow.

This barrier can be minimized with Matt Might's suggestions for [low-cost academic blogging](https://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-blog-as-an-academic/), which suggests harnessing material that you're already writing for some other purpose (e.g. class assignment, project, email).

## Tangent: With great communication comes great responsibility

Good communication does a lot for humanity: think of engaging popular scientists like Bill Nye or critical updates transmitted during a natural disaster! However, good communication should not be used to make up for poor scientific merit.

With self-proclaimed experts surrounded by a laxer burden of proof among laypeople, ["cargo cult science"](https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm) (wonderful read) can thrive--work that looks like science, but falls apart under scrutiny.

For a good example of empty science presented as groundbreaking, look to former MIT Media Lab member Neri Oxman (who produced little but a [cool-looking marble](https://oxman.com/projects/totems) for Jeffrey Epstein) or UPenn psychologist Angela Duckworth (who wrote extensively about "grit" as some breakthrough despite its [dubious predictive ability](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27845531/)). (I'm actually halfway through reading Grit out of curiousity.)

In short, communication should be used to make valuable information accessible, not pollute the [meme pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme_pool).
